I'm moving the programming stuff over to [`https://overcoming.software`](https://overcoming.software).

Well, I will at *some point* in the future. 
But I don't want to break links.
So I need to setup a server at this domain which has a permanent redirect to the relevant `overcoming.software` domain.
That's a decent amount of work, which I don't have time for, so this probably won't happen any time soon.
