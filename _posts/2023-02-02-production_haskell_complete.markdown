I'm happy to announce that my book "Production Haskell" is complete.

The book is a 500+ page distillation of my experience working with Haskell in industry.
I believe it's the best resource available for building and scaling the use of Haskell in business.

To buy the ebook, go to [the Leanpub page](https://leanpub.com/production-haskell) - the price is slightly lower here than on Amazon.

To buy hard copies, go to [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTNSJRKD).

Thanks to all of you for reading my blog, commenting on Reddit, and encouraging me to write the book in the first place.
