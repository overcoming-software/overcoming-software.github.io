I am happy to announce that I have married Emily von Hagen.
I am taking her name.

I will be registering new account names to remove `Parsons` from things.
However, the URLs on the web live forever, and this blog will remain up.
I will eventually (he says, again) make a forwarding service and complete the migration to `overcoming.software`.
